                     <p>
                        In networking, a firewall could be described as a specially designed device that controls the spreading of a network threat. The most commonly talked about source of network threats is the Internet. The Internet is the home of many unknown people that we cannot trust. There are hackers on the Internet that may want to do our networks harm. We can use a firewall to impede an untrusted person from doing damage to our networks. <br><br>
                        A more textbook definition of a computer firewall is that it is a method or device that regulates the level of trust between two or more networks. A firewall can consist of software, hardware or a combination of both. A firewall can protect your network from the Internet as well as regulate the traffic between networks within the same company. <br><br>
                        For instance, a firewall can allow the legal department's network to have access to the marketing file server but the marketing department can be refused access to legal. In this example the firewall is positioned between the marketing and legal networks so that all communication must pass through the firewall. The firewall is then able to ensure that only authorized packets are allowed.

                     <p>
                        A packet-filtering firewall is a router or computer running software that has been configured to screen incoming and outgoing packets. A packet-filtering firewall accepts or denies packets based on information contained in the packets' TCP and IP headers. For example, most packet-filtering firewalls can accept or deny a packet based on the packet's full association, which consists of the following:<br><br>
                        - Source address<br>
                        - Destination address<br>
                        - Application or protocol<br>
                        - Source port number<br>
                        - Destination port number<br>
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        A circuit-level gateway monitors TCP handshaking between packets from trusted clients or servers to untrusted hosts and vice versa to determine whether a requested session is legitimate. To filter packets in this way, a circuit-level gateway relies on data contained in the packet headers for the Internet's TCP session-layer protocol. Because a circuit-level gateway filters packets at the session layer of the OSI model, this gateway operates two layers higher than a packet-filtering firewall does. <br>

                     <p>
                        Like a circuit-level gateway, an application-level gateway intercepts incoming and outgoing packets, runs proxies that copy and forward information across the gateway, and functions as a proxy server, preventing any direct connection between a trusted server or client and an untrusted host. However, the proxies that an application-level gateway runs differ in two important ways from the pipe proxies that a circuit-level gateway uses:<br><br>
                        - The proxies are application specific<br>
                        - The proxies can filter packets at the application layer of the OSI model.<br>
