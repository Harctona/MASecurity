                     <p>
                        In networking, a firewall could be described as a specially designed device that controls the spreading of a network threat. The most commonly talked about source of network threats is the Internet. The Internet is the home of many unknown people that we cannot trust. There are hackers on the Internet that may want to do our networks harm. We can use a firewall to impede an untrusted person from doing damage to our networks. <br><br>
                        A more textbook definition of a computer firewall is that it is a method or device that regulates the level of trust between two or more networks. A firewall can consist of software, hardware or a combination of both. A firewall can protect your network from the Internet as well as regulate the traffic between networks within the same company. <br><br>
                        For instance, a firewall can allow the legal department's network to have access to the marketing file server but the marketing department can be refused access to legal. In this example the firewall is positioned between the marketing and legal networks so that all communication must pass through the firewall. The firewall is then able to ensure that only authorized packets are allowed.

                              Everyone has a unique, unchanging fingerprint. A fingerprint is made of a series of ridges and furrows on the surface of the finger and these are used to determine the uniqueness of the fingerprint. Once registered on the fingerprint scanner, the image of these patterns is converted into a code through a mathematical sequence called an algorithm which effectively becomes a digital form of you. This is stored on a database for comparison which grants authentication and access through the secured door. <br><br>
                              Using fingerprints for identification and recognition is the oldest use of biometrics. Nowadays, even laptops and USB pen drives can be found with fingerprint readers. But, there are many reasons why the use of fingerprints is the most common form of biometric security. Firstly, fingerprinting will remain a reliable form of security even as you age. Iris and facial recognition in particular cannot overcome feature changes, whereas through using a biometric fingerprint scanner, the fingerprint will stand the test of time. Also, you will not need to change anything about the appearance of your fingerprints. If you wear glasses or have hair obstructing certain points of the face for example you will need to remove the glasses or pull back your hair each time you present your face for scanning.

Iris recognition is an automated method of biometric identification that uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques on video images of one or both of the irises of an individual's eyes, whose complex random patterns are unique, stable, and can be seen from some distance.<br><br>
Retinal scanning is a different, ocular-based biometric technology that uses the unique patterns on a person's retina blood vessels and is often confused with iris recognition. Iris recognition uses video camera technology with subtle near infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris which are visible externally. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow the identification of an individual or someone pretending to be that individual. Databases of enrolled templates are searched by matcher engines at speeds measured in the millions of templates per second per (single-core) CPU, and with remarkably low false match rates.<br><br>
Several hundred millions of persons in several countries around the world have been enrolled in iris recognition systems for convenience purposes such as passport-free automated border-crossings, and some national ID programs. A key advantage of iris recognition, besides its speed of matching and its extreme resistance to false matches, is the stability of the iris as an internal and protected, yet externally visible organ of the eye.<br><br>
