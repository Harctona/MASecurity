                        Biometrics can be taken literally as 'life measurement' but the term is usually associated with the measurement and use of unique physiological characteristics to identify an individual such as fingerprints, DNA or the iris. The phenomenon is mostly associated with security because biometric traits can be used for authentication, where a special characteristic of an individual is used to identify them.

                              Everyone has a unique, unchanging fingerprint. A fingerprint is made of a series of ridges and furrows on the surface of the finger and these are used to determine the uniqueness of the fingerprint. Once registered on the fingerprint scanner, the image of these patterns is converted into a code through a mathematical sequence called an algorithm which effectively becomes a digital form of you. This is stored on a database for comparison which grants authentication and access through the secured door. <br><br>
                              Using fingerprints for identification and recognition is the oldest use of biometrics. Nowadays, even laptops and USB pen drives can be found with fingerprint readers. But, there are many reasons why the use of fingerprints is the most common form of biometric security. Firstly, fingerprinting will remain a reliable form of security even as you age. Iris and facial recognition in particular cannot overcome feature changes, whereas through using a biometric fingerprint scanner, the fingerprint will stand the test of time. Also, you will not need to change anything about the appearance of your fingerprints. If you wear glasses or have hair obstructing certain points of the face for example you will need to remove the glasses or pull back your hair each time you present your face for scanning.

Iris recognition is an automated method of biometric identification that uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques on video images of one or both of the irises of an individual's eyes, whose complex random patterns are unique, stable, and can be seen from some distance.<br><br>
Retinal scanning is a different, ocular-based biometric technology that uses the unique patterns on a person's retina blood vessels and is often confused with iris recognition. Iris recognition uses video camera technology with subtle near infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris which are visible externally. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow the identification of an individual or someone pretending to be that individual. Databases of enrolled templates are searched by matcher engines at speeds measured in the millions of templates per second per (single-core) CPU, and with remarkably low false match rates.<br><br>
Several hundred millions of persons in several countries around the world have been enrolled in iris recognition systems for convenience purposes such as passport-free automated border-crossings, and some national ID programs. A key advantage of iris recognition, besides its speed of matching and its extreme resistance to false matches, is the stability of the iris as an internal and protected, yet externally visible organ of the eye.<br><br>
