                     <p>
                        Encryption is a modern form of cryptography that allows a user to hide information from others. Encryption uses a complex algorithm called a cipher in order to turn normalized data (plaintext) into a series of seemingly random characters (cipher text) that is unreadable by those without a special key in which to decrypt it. Those that possess the key can decrypt the data in order to view the plaintext again rather than the random character string of cipher text.<br><br>
                        Two of the most widely used encryption methods are Public key (asymmetric) encryption and Private Key (symmetric) encryption. The two are similar in the sense that they both allow a user to encrypt data to hide it from others, and then decrypt it in order to access the original plaintext. They differ, however, in how they handle the steps between encryption and decryption.<br><br>

                              Public Key, or asymmetric, encryption uses the recipient's public key as well as a (mathematically) matching private key.<br><br>
                              For example, if James and Amelia both had keys to a box, with James having the public key and Amelia having a matching private key, James could use his key to unlock the box and put things into it, but he wouldn't be able to view items already in there, nor would he be able to retrieve anything. Amelia, on the other hand, could open the box and view all items inside as well as removing them as she saw fit by using her matching private key. She could not, however, add things to the box without having an additional public key.<br><br>
                              In a digital sense, James can encrypt plaintext (with his public key), and send it to Amelia, but only Amelia (and her matching private key) could decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. The public key (in this scenario) is used for encrypting cipher text, while the private key is used to decrypt it back into plaintext. Amelia would only need the private key to decrypt James's message, but she'd need access to an additional public key in order to encrypt a message and send it back to James. James on the other hand couldn't decrypt the data with his public key, but he could use it to send Amelia an encrypted message.<br><br>

                              Where Private Key - or symmetric - encryption differs from Public Key encryption is in the purpose of the keys themselves. There are still two keys needed to communicate, but each of these keys is now essentially the same. <br><br>
                              For example, James and Amelia both possess keys to the aforementioned box, but in this scenario the keys do the same thing. Both of them are now able to add or remove things from the box.<br><br>
                              Speaking digitally, James can now encrypt a message as well as decrypting it with his key. Amelia can do the same with hers.<br><br>
